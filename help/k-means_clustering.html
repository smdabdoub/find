			The algorithm is re-run a number of times specified by this parameter, each time a new 
			set of initial cluster centers are chosen. The results of each run are compared to find 
			the best.

		<td valign='top'><b>Manually select centers</b></td>
		<td valign='top'>
			This option allows the user to (in a separate window that pops up) to choose the initial 
			centers of the clusters by clicking within the data space in any set of 2 dimensions. 
			Choosing this parameter will remove the need to specify the number of target clusters 
			as well as the option to re-run multiple times. Consequently, those options are 
			disabled when this option is checked.

			Upon completion of the clustering, the result will be displayed as a colored
